If you’ve never used git or github before, there are a bunch of things that you need to do. It’s [very well explained on github](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git), but repeated here for completeness.
- Get a github account
- Download and install git. For Linux users, this comes already preinstalled. To check, simply type ```git --version``` on your terminal
  - To install git on ubuntu, `$ sudo apt-get update` followed by `$ sudo apt-get install git`
